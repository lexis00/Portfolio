Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. Thank you for visiting; this application is called My Maintenance.

This project was inspired by my aspiration to learn frameworks such as Spring Boot and gain hands-on experience integrating a database into a web application. The project leverages tools including Spring Boot, Java, MySQL, Maven, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a database that stores customer vehicle maintenance notes.

The primary issue addressed by this application is the difficulty customers face in obtaining detailed information about their car service. My Maintenance provides a solution for car maintenance companies, offering a microservice that can be integrated into a larger website.
