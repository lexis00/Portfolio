Hi! Thank you for visiting my GitHub and viewing this project. 

Embarking on my journey as an aspiring developer, I undertook a common yet pivotal project: an alien invasion game in the popular Python Crash Course book. With this being my first complex project, I followed a popular demo. This demo provided a structured approach to the project and served as a valuable learning resource, introducing me to the intricacies of game development using pygame. Following the step-by-step tutorial, I gained insights into fundamental concepts such as sprite manipulation, collision detection, and event handling, all crucial elements for crafting an engaging game.

This guided learning experience allowed me to grasp the practical application of coding principles in a tangible project. Debugging challenges in real-time, as highlighted in the tutorial, honed my troubleshooting skills and equipped me with the ability to address issues dynamically.

Run the alien_invasion.py file to the play the game.
